# Status Seekers

This is an initial proof of concept for interacting with a very simple set of smart contracts as you explore an upcoming artwork by the Truebit team and an amazing artist named Jessica Angel.

The basic idea is to create a number of smaller installations - quite literally just QR codes - that people will need to find by exploring the much bigger piece being created by Angel et al. The whole idea is to bring into the physical world a tactile, interactive space which represents the radical shift now underway in the way we organize through decentralized networks incentivized by tokens. If we can get people to explore that space with deep attention to it's minute details, that will be a great success. We need better and bigger metaphors if we are to form properly the sorts of intentions that will make networks like Ethereum truly world-changing.

Moreover, we think that being able to illustrate that all it takes in order to interact with and benefit from using thse networks is a piece of technology that already exists in your pocket and with which a growing majority of the world is already familiar, then that will be the cherry on top.

As always, this is about The State of Us.
